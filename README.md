# twitter_stream
Notebooks to experiment with twitter streaming. 

# Introduction
There are two notebooks in here, a simple stream and a visualization. You need to get the simple stream running first, and KEEP IT RUNNING while you run the visualization notebook. The first notebook is what feeds the database, and the visualization won't work without it.

# Credentials
If you don't already have them, you need to get your API credentials from Twitter and enter them in credentials.py. 

# MySQL
This was a super pain in the ass to get running on the Mac. I was really surprised. Let me know if you're more successful.
